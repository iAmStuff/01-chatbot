# TO DO

## Important

- Ask for username and utilize it during conversation
- Optimize parseType function to use loops or other functions to avoid repetition

## Optional

- Add ability to change userName at any point during the conversation. (I think this one might be difficult given how the getDiscussionTree function rewrites currentBranch in its entirety)

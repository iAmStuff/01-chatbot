# TO DO

## Important

- [x] Ask for username and utilize it during conversation
- [x] Optimize parseType function to use loops or other functions to avoid repetition
- [x] Add an actual response when input fails to validate as expected

## Optional

- [ ] Add ability to change userName at any point during the conversation. (I think this one might be difficult given how the getDiscussionTree function rewrites currentBranch in its entirety)
- [ ] Add more usage of the user's name in discussionTree

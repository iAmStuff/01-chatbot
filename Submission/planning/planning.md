## Problem statement:

Create an anime recommendation chatbot.
The bot will ask for a name to refer to the user by, before asking several questions to ascertain the user's interests.
The bot will internally divide numerous anime titles into categories that can be sorted through as the conversation continues, once the bot has narrowed down the results several times, a random answer will be chosen from a list of titles from a specific category.

### Titles may be assigned a category such as:

- Genre (action / romance / slice of life)
- Target age demographic (shounen / shoujou / seinen / josei)
- Setting (fantasy / future / high-school / workplace / ...)
- Maturity level (related to age demographic, but may further define anime that develops complex topics such as political and ethical dilemmas.)
- "Gateway status" (for anime that serves as a good introduction to the medium. because some shows really don't go easy on new viewers.)

### Some of the questions the bot could ask may include:

- Have you watched anime before?
- Would you rather watch action/shounen or romance/shoujo genres?
- Do you want to watch an ongoing series or something that has already finished airing?
  - If not ongoing, perhaps you may like to go watch some of those "must-watch" classics?
- Do you want to watch something lightweight, or maybe something more serious?
- Are you able to switch your brain off and enjoy the absolute trash and degeneracy the worse end of this art medium has to offer?
  - In which case, are you alone, preferably wearing headphones so your family doesn't come asking questions?

## How do you think you did?

Fairly well.

## Did you struggle with any parts of the assignment?

Many times I got stuck on this project. Though most of my blockages were my own doing, since I wanted to overcomplicate things like I usually do. But I got there in the end.

## What would you do differently next time?

Now that I have a better understanding of the tools available to build a project like this, I would spend more time planning my moves ahead of time. Unfortunately this time around I lack enough knowledge and foresight to be able to plan far ahead. I just sort of have to get in there and start bashing rocks together, y'know? But as I learn my and my confidence in my ability grows, I'll be able to plan more in advance.

## Was the assignment relevant to the topics covered in the tutorial videos and meetings?

Yes

## Would you like to add any other feedback?

I can't think of anything else right now. Brain dead. No thoughts. Head empty.
